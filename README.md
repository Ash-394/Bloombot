#Bloombot

Bloombot, a bot that retrieves web3 learning resources in one click. 

#usecase
In the web3 ecosystem resources are limited and scattered and might be too much overwhelming for a newbie. Our bloombot makes any enthusiast's web3 journey easier. Ask anything about web3 and you have the answer then and there.

Our mission is to provide precise and individualized responses to any issues relevant to the web3 universe, including inquiries about the most recent trends and values in cryptocurrencies.
With Bloombot, organisations and contributors may achieve maximum efficiency and expand.

#Challenges we ran into
Because there were so many protocols that were available to incorporate into our solution, the most significant obstacle that we faced was determining which issue statement we should concentrate on.
Because we are novices with an insatiable appetite for knowledge, we struggled to make sense of which protocols would be applicable to our project and how to make accommodations for them. However, we were able to overcome this challenge by acquiring a great deal of new information throughout the course of our work on this project.
While interacting with Bloombot, we came across the challenge of optimising gas fees; we were able to find a solution to this problem by implementing biconomy. In addition, because there are numerous potential applications for this product, we had a difficult time deciding which resources should be utilised for the demonstration at this moment.

#Push protocol
We have used push chat for creating a chatbot.
Push Chat requires no personal information whatsoever to start messaging on the protocol. 
All the user needs is a wallet address.
All the messages are stored on IPFS and are encrypted as well as signed.

So with the push chat there will be a wallet address related to the bot and then users can send messages to the bot with their wallet address. The bot can fetch the required responses from the database as per the query. 

#Biconomy
Every user needs a wallet address to chat with the bot. We plan to implement the signin using the biconomy sdk.
Biconomy sdk makes it easier for users unfamiliar with wallets to sign-in by combining traditional social sign-in and Web3 login.

#lens protocol
We provide lens profile to all the contributers. If a user wants to reward the contributor he/she can connect with contributor and send incentives.

#Future advancements

We plan to build a community around this  where anyone can contibute resources related to web3
